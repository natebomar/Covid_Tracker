# Coach Nelson's Project
Big Picture:
Coach Nelson wants a website that he can enter his practice plan into.
He assigns different drills/workouts to different time slots.
Then, the Website will send the practice plan to his phone.
An alarm or notification goes off every time that they need to move on in practice.
They move on when they reach the next time slot.
He wants to be able to send the schedule to the other coaches.
