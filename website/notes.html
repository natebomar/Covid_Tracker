<!--
    These are the basics of HTML5. Comments will explain how it works.
    
    IT SHOULD BE NOTED that HTML is used for web page design, and when refencing, the "program", "output", or "webpage"
    I am referencing the webpage made by the code.
    *An example project will be done in full at the bottom of the notes.*
-->
<!--
    Html uses tags to start and end each line, telling them what to do. Open tags use < >, close tags use </ >
-->
<!--
    There are a few elements Every HTML page needs to start with:

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. 
HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification,
which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line,
where the ... part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.

The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. 
The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line, 
and the closing </html> goes at the end of the page.

Here's an example of the page structure. Your HTML code would go in the space between the two html tags:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>
-->
<!--
    There are 5 higly important, descriptive tags within HTML:
    main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section
    The descriptions of each will be added upon use of the tag
-->
<!--<h1>Hello World</h1>-->
<!--
    The <h> tag makes a headline, each headline can be numbered h1, h2, h3, etc.
-->
<!--
    <h2>Cat Photo App</h2>
-->
<!--
    This line prints a headline below the provious one, as indicated by its number
-->
<!--
    <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->
<!--
    The <p> tag indicates paragraph text, and is used for displaying bulk text
-->



<!--
    The <main> tag is higly useful, as it designates itself as the main block of code
    Whatever is typed in the main is displayed and this will hold the bulk of the code 
    When linking to other websites or other sections, this is done in main
-->



<!--
    The <a> tag is called an anchor, and links elements to content outside of the webpage. anchors require a
    reference link
        Example:
        <a href="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com"> cat photos</a>
         href is the reference link, and in this example, "cat photos" was the anchor text that will send the user to this link
-->

<!--
    In adition to links outside the webpage, <a> can link to a different part of the internal webpage itself
    This is done by setting the beginning of the href as a #, and the destination must contain an id
    Example:
        <a href= "#footer"> Bottom of Page</a>
    To do this example, you must use a footer...
-->
<!--
    The <a> tag is extremely powerful, as you can nest an anchor within a text, or on an image, or possibly
    even set a dead link that can be assigned a location later:
        Example of nesting within text:
            <p> Click <a href = "https://url.com/thisisareallink"> this link</a> to view some puppy pictures</p>
        The webpage will display: Click this link("this link" will be higlighted) to view some puppy pictures

        Example of anchoring an image:
        <a href ="https://linktoimage.com"><img src = "https://url.link/thisisreal" alt = "This will display if 
            the imgae doesn't"></a>
        Clicking the image will send you to the link displayed

        Example of a dead link:
        <a href ="#">Follow link</a>
-->


<!--
    The <footer> tag is found at the bottom most section of the webpage being made
    You may refence the footer in main or some other tag, and when anchoring to footer, we must declare it with an id
    Example:
        <footer id="footer">
            code goes here
        </footer>
    
    This way, when a reference link is set to :"#footer", the anchor will direct to this footer now that it has been id-ed
-->



<!--
    The <ui> tag, or unordered list tag, creates bullet point style text.
    Example:
        <ui>
            <li> first bullet </li>
            <li> second bullet </li>
            <li> third bullet </li>
            ...
        </ui>
        Prints:
        first bullet
        second bullet
        third bullet
        ...
-->
<!--
    The <oi> tag, or ordered list tag, creates a numbered list style of text
    Example:
        <oi>
            <li> first </li>
            <li> second </li>
            <li> third </li>
            ...
        Prints:
        1. first
        2. second
        3. third
        ...
-->




<!--
    INPUT INPUT INPUT 

    To take in input on the webpage, we need to use the input tag
    This tag closes on its own, but needs to be provided a type of input being taken in

    Example:
    <input type = "Text">
-->
<!--
    In order to have place holder text for your input, you need to indicate the string of text you want to placehold
    Example:
    <input type = "text" placeholder = "this is a placeholder text"
-->

<!-- 
    You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. 
    You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.
    You can then nest input within the form to take in information and direst it to where you want it.
        Example:
        <form action ="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
        </form>
    In order to allow the user to enter the input, we add a submit button to the form
    Clicking this button send the information to the action link.
        Example:
        <form action ="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
        <button type = "submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    When you want input to be required before the user can pass the form, then you can specify this
        Example:
        <form action ="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <input type="text" required placeholder="cat photo URL">
        <button type = "submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
-->

<!--
        A radio button is a special type of INPUT that takes in one answer to multiple options(multiple choice)
        Radio buttons are made up of several elements : an id, a type("radio"), and a name.
        Radio buttons are usually linked to one another in radio groups, which are made by making multiple
        radio buttons with the same name
        Example:
        <form action = "https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <input id ="indoor" type = "radio" name = "location">indoor
            <input id = "outdoor" type = "radio" name= "location"> outdoor
        </form>

        In the example, the radio group is named location, meaning that the user can only pick indoor or 
        outdoor
-->
<!--
    When making radio input groups, we usually seperate them by labels, and we signify what the label is for
    Ex.
    <form action ="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <label for="indoor">
            <input id="indoor" type ="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">indoor
        </label>
        <label for "outdoor">
            <input id="outdoor" type ="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">outdoor
        </label>
    </form>
-->
<!-- 
    Another type of INPUT is checkboxes. These serve as a mark all that apply input.
    Usual setup is as follows, much like radio input, they can be put in groups:
        Ex.
            <label for ="happy"><input id="happy" type="checkbox"name="personality">happy</label>
            <label for ="distant"><input id="distant"type="checkbox" name="personality">distant</label>
            <label for="loving"><input id ="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality">loving</label>
-->


<!--
    EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: INPUT WILL NOT BE VALUABLE WITHOUT THIS

    To take in actual value from our input, we need to assign a value to the input
    When there is no value assigned to the input, you cannot access what a user puts
    Example:
        <form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
            <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
            <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving"> Loving</label>
            <label for="lazy"><input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy"> Lazy</label>
            <label for="energetic"><input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic"> Energetic</label><br>
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
-->

<!--
    In order to pre-check an input box, we can put the word checked after the name attribute
    Ex.
        <label for = "indoor><input id="indoor" value = "indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked></label>
    The above input will be pre checked in the radio group, and the user would have to check
    a different box to switch the value
-->

<!--
    The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.
    The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.
    Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> 
    and close it on another line with </div>.
-->

<!--
    FORMAT NOTES TO FINISH OFF THE BASICS:

    You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags
    with the head and body elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag.
    Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

    Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

    Example Layout:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta />
            </head>
            <body>
                <div>
                </div>
            </body>
        </html>
